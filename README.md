# Starter Android

## Introduction
Starter Android is a boilerplate project aimed at helping developers jumpstart their Android application development. This project simplifies the setup process and includes a pre-configured environment with Retrofit for networking, Koin for dependency injection, and an MVI architecture pattern to provide a robust and maintainable structure. Additionally, it utilizes Kotlin Coroutines, Flow, and Channels for efficient data transfer and state management.

## Features
- **Retrofit**: Simplify network calls with a type-safe HTTP client.
- **Koin**: A pragmatic lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin.
- **Kotlin Coroutines**: Handle asynchronous programming smoothly and efficiently.
- **MVI Architecture**: Maintainable and predictable architecture pattern, separating the user interface (UI) from the business logic.
- **Coroutines Flow and Channel**: Advanced techniques for data streaming and handling complex asynchronous operations.

## Getting Started
To get started with Starter Android, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
